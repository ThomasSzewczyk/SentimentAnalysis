# SentimentAnalysis

This is the Final Project I created for My Data Structures Class. 
The program reads in a training coprus,in this case: a text file consisting of movie reviews. Then the program inputs this data into a BinarySearchTree consisting of Word Objects. The main script runs a input/output interface where the user inputs a text fragment and the program returns a numerical value corresponding to the fragmets polarity(very positive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative) based on the polar values assigned to the movie reviews in the training corpus.
